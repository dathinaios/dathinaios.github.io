I am a musician / sound designer / software developer. I have worked extensively with the [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net) audio programming language which was the main tool during my PhD research. I have since used a variety of technologies, currently focusing on software development for audio applications and the creation of tools for artists working with sound in unconventional ways. I am the director of the UK-based Music & Audio company [FasmaTwist](https://www.fasmatwist.com).
