      <description>I am a musician / sound designer / software developer. I have worked extensively with the SuperCollider audio programming language which was the main tool during my PhD research. I have since used a variety of technologies, currently focusing on software development for audio applications and the creation of tools for artists working with sound in unconventional ways. I am the director of the UK-based Music &amp;amp; Audio company FasmaTwist.</description>

      <description>Code CuePlayer A tool for composing and performing real-time and mixed electronic works using the SuperCollider language. It helps a composer to organise processes and musical material in bundles (cues) and execute them when needed during the course of a piece. It is particularly applicable to musical works incorporating real-time electronics and acoustic instruments; it may also be handy in any scenario where the composer wishes to organise, schedule and trigger bundles of processes.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sound Environments: Concepts and Methods</title>

      <description>Introduction This article presents concepts that are useful for the creation of virtual sound environments. Although in most cases it uses examples from the real world, the concepts should not be viewed as an attempt to categorise, analyse or model real soundscapes. Throughout, the focus is on the creation of perceptually clear and dynamic virtual sound environments that allude to the experience of sound spaces and events, much in the same way that this is done in video games.</description>
