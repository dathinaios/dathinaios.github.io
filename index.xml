      <description>I am a musician / sound designer / software developer. I have worked extensively with the SuperCollider audio programming language which was the main tool during my PhD research. I have since used a variety of technologies, currently focusing on software development for audio applications and the creation of tools for artists working with sound in unconventional ways. I am the director of the UK-based Music &amp;amp; Audio company FasmaTwist.</description>

      <description>Code CuePlayer A tool for composing and performing real-time and mixed electronic works using the SuperCollider language. It helps a composer to organise processes and musical material in bundles (cues) and execute them when needed during the course of a piece. It is particularly applicable to musical works incorporating real-time electronics and acoustic instruments; it may also be handy in any scenario where the composer wishes to organise, schedule and trigger bundles of processes.</description>
